# To do:
    # Physics: "Fixed angle of the cue ball after impact"..."Fixed ball collisions bug (check out the '.in contact; variable"
        #..."maybe check the ball/wall collisions for every pixel of movement "..."ball guide line"
    # Gameplay: "Ball in hand (made it pulse at the right time)"..."Drag the ball"..."End game scenarios"..."
    # Presentation: "Player names?"...
